# Project Title

Get Found's entry for Hack For A Cause 2018 on the Trans*Ponder project!


### Installing

Unzip into your Wordpress plugin folder.

You'll need to create Wordpress pages with the following slugs:

community-submission
directory
volunteer-queue
admin-queue
volunteer-form
admin-form

And the following tables:

wp_provider_subtype
wp_provider_type
wp_community_form
wp_volunteer_form

Sorry, no installer. :/

## To-Do

If it's coded in, it should work (mostly). A lot of stuff needs to be added, though!
